            <h6>Butter Chicken</h6>
            <p>As someone who loves food with big, BIG flavours, it‚Äôs no surprise that Indian is one of my favourite foods. A good curry and binge watching Netflix is pretty much my idea of a perfect Friday night. #NanaAlert! üòÇ
                As much as I love making Indian food at home, sometimes I find the list of ingredients daunting. It‚Äôs easy enough to make once I gather all the ingredients, but that‚Äôs where I usually fall short because it requires a trip to an Indian grocery store ‚Äì and my closest one is a fair drive away.
                Butter Chicken is one of the few exceptions. I was elated when I discovered a Chef recipe for Butter Chicken and realised how easy it is. But more importantly, you can get all the ingredients from any supermarket. Yes!

            <h6>Biryani</h6>
            <p>Biryani (/ b…úÀêrÀàj…ëÀêni /) is a mixed rice dish most popular in South Asia. It is made with rice, some type of meat (chicken, beef, goat, lamb, prawn, or fish) and spices.

            <h6>Paneer Tikka</h6>
            <p>Paneer Tikka is a popular and delicious tandoori snack where Paneer (Indian cottage cheese cubes) are marinated in a spiced yogurt-based marinade, arranged on skewers and grilled in the oven. Tikka basically means anything that is marinated and then baked or grilled or fried and paneer tikka is a popular vegetarian tikka dish. This tasty homemade version is similar to the dish served in restaurants, but I would say actually tastes better!
                The Indian spice powders mixed with the yogurt (curd) make a flavorful marinade that is soaked up by the porous paneer cubes. Grilling the skewers then produces a nice slightly crispiness on the paneer.

            <h6>Rogan Josh</h6>
            <p>The lovely color of rogan josh (sometimes spelled roghan josh or roghan ghosht) comes from the Kashmiri dry red chiles used to prepare it. When you read the recipe, it may seem like you will end up with a fiery dish, but do not fear‚Äîthe chiles add fantastic flavor to the Indian curry without making it too spicy. Whole spices along with ground and fresh spices are what add layer upon layer of flavor to this Indian curry. Marinating the lamb in yogurt helps to tenderize the meat, and a touch of cream at the end gives the dish a little richness.</p>
